## Introduction
BookLab allows users to quickly scan the books on their bookshelves and provides
recommendations based on your collection when scanning other bookshelves. Click

## Quick Start

### Getting the source
Download the source code by running the following code in your command prompt:
```sh
git clone https://gitlab.ewi.tudelft.nl/TI2806/2017-2018/MS/ms1/ms1.git
```
or simply 
[grab](https://gitlab.ewi.tudelft.nl/TI2806/2017-2018/MS/ms1/ms1/-/archive/master/ms1-master.zip) 
a copy of the source code as a Zip file.

### Deployment Types
The project provides multiple deployment types:
- **Testing**  
  This deployment type is suitable for testing and development environments and uses an in-memory database
  to store the data. This deployment uses the latest, cutting-edge technology for book detection and recommendation.
- **Production**  
  This deployment type is suitable for a production environment and uses a Postgres as backing database.
  This deployment uses the latest, cutting-edge technology for book detection and recommendation.
- **OSS**  
  This deployment type is similar to the testing deployment type, but does not rely on external (Google) services for
  book detection and text extraction. This type should be preferred if using the (paid) services from Google forms a problem.

### Deploy (with Docker)
Make sure you have done the following:
- **Install and start Docker**  
  Docker should be running before you are able to build the images. See [Docker](https://docker.com) for more information
  on installing it. On Windows, make sure you have exposed the daemon without TLS (you can change this in Settings).
- **Install docker-compose**  
  Make sure that `docker-compose` is installed on your system. See [this page](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
  on how to install the program.
- **Add Google Books API key to environment**
  Add the API key for Google Books to your environmental variables under the name `GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY`.
  See [this page](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using#APIKey) on how to acquire an API key.
- **Copy Google Cloud credentials to configuration folder**  
  The key file for your Google Cloud service account should be put in the `config` directory right in the root of the
  project as `keys.json`.
  See [this page](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started) on how to acquire a service account for
  Google Cloud and generate a key file. Make sure you have enabled the Google Vision API.

After that, run the following command to build the Docker images for the project:
```sh
./gradlew dockerBuildImage
```

Finally, you can start the images using `docker-compose`. Make sure that you have set the `TAG` environmental variable
to the version you want to deploy (e.g 1.0).
```sh
docker-compose up
```

The website will now be available at [http://localhost](http://localhost).
### Deploy (without Docker)
Make sure the following variables are defined in your environment:
- **GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY**   
  An API key for Google Books which allows the backend server to query its catalogue. See [this page](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using#APIKey)
  on how to acquire an API key.
- **GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS**
  The path to your Google Cloud service account keys. See [this page](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started) on
  how to acquire a service account for Google Cloud and generate a key file. Make sure you have enabled the Google Vision API.

After that, run the following command to start the backend (testing deployment):
```sh
./gradlew :booklab-deployment-testing:run
```

To run the frontend run the following code in your command prompt within the `booklab-frontend-web` 
folder. Make sure you have installed the dependencies of the project using `npm install`.
```sh
npm run ng serve -- --open
```
This will automatically open the frontend on [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

## Development
Before starting development, make sure you have the correct environmental variables defined. See
the deployment steps on which variables have to be defined.

### Backend
In order to run the tests and the linter, enter the following code in your command prompt:
```sh
./gradlew check
```
This command will show all the tests that fail and possible formatting errors.

### Frontend (Angular)
In order to run the tests for the Angular frontend, enter the following code in your command prompt in the `booklab-frontend`
directory:
```sh
npm run test
```

Additionally, if you want to check the source code for formatting errors, run:
```sh 
npm run lint
```

Finally, if you want to run the end-to-end tests, run:
```sh 
npm run e2e
```

### Building without mobile applications
If you do not have the Android SDK or iOS SDK installed and you are not interested in building
the mobile applications, either:

- Set the environmental variable to ignore the projects:  
  `ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_exclude=booklab-frontend-ios,booklab-frontend-android`
- Set the `exclude` property in your `gradle.properties`:  
  `exclude=booklab-frontend-ios,booklab-frontend-android`
